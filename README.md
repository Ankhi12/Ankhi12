### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello There!! I am Ankhi, and I enjoy writing efficient and meaningful codes.

At some point, I decided to explore the marketing side of the IT industry -- as I was not getting enough exposure to see the real-world impact of my coding efforts.

Since then, I have gone above and beyond my role to assist my team with marketing and UI development efforts. 

Not only that, I leverage my marketing skills with my coding knowledge to explain complex programming concepts through my blogs, which I see as a way to give back to the community :)

All these experiences have made me more knowledgeable, and I am now eager to help companies develop software.

I am particularly interested in solving complex business problems, both in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and React JS, and back-end tech involving MongoDB, API development, and SQL..

**Skills**
1. JavaScript
2. React
3. React Redux
4. Node JS
5. Express JS
6. Mongoose & MongoDB
7. API programming
8. API testing using Postman
9. HTML5 & CSS
10. SEO - Intermediate level


Thank You for reading my profile & take care!
