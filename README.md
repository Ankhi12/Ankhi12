### Hi there üëã

Hello There!! I am Ankhi, and I enjoy writing efficient and meaningful codes.

Somewhere along the line, I went on to explore the marketing part of the IT industry---as I didn't get much exposure to witnessing the impact of my coding efforts in real life.
                
Along the way, I have gone above and beyond my current role to assist my team with UI development and enhancements. 
                
Not only that, I leverage my marketing skills with coding knowledge to explain complex programming concepts to people online through my blogs as a token of appreciation :)
                
All this experience has made me better and more knowledgeable than ever, and now I am looking forward to helping companies with developing software.
                
My interest lies in solving complex business problems in both front-end (HTML, CSS, React JS) and back-end (MongoDB, API development, and SQL) aspects.

**Skills**
1. JavaScript
2. React
3. React Redux
4. Node JS
5. Express JS
6. Mongoose & MongoDB
7. API programming
8. API testing using Postman
9. HTML5 & CSS
10. SEO - Intermediate level

‚úîÔ∏è I am open for collabortion or learning.

üëã Thank You & take care!
