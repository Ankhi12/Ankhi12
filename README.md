### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my profile.

💻 I am a MERN Fullstack developer, content creator, and a problem solver.

🔥 I have found my passion in coding after going through an unconventional career path. 
Mainly due to coding being transparent and also as a great way to keep my cognitive skills alive :D

👍 Most of the time the thrill of an optimized code's output gives me the fuel to be a better software development each and every day!

📓 When it comes to problem solving, i have developed a keen way into looking into a business problem both from the technical and business aspects. Then, approaching the problem.

✔️ I am open for a chat for collabortion or learning.

👋 Thank You & take care!
